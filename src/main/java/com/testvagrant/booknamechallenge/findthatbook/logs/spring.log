A YOUNG COUNTRY, A TIMELESS CIVILISATION EXPLORE IT WITH INDIA'S VERY OWN STORYTELLER, AMISH<br /><br />India, a culture that witnessed the dawn of civilisation. That witnessed the rise of other cultures and watched them turn to dust. It has been celebrated and attacked. Admired and vilified. But through all these millennia, after all the ups and downs of history, it's still here! And now, after a few centuries of decline, it's driving a new dawn once again. Ajanaabhavarsh. Bharat.

An Unforgettable Battle.<br /><br />India, 1025 AD.<br /><br />Repeated attacks by Mahmud of Ghazni and his barbaric Turkic hordes have weakened India’s northern regions. The invaders lay waste to vast swathes of India — plundering, killing, raping, pillaging. Many of the old Indian kingdoms, tired and divided, fall to them. Even those who battle on are shackled by old codes of chivalry, and are unable to stop an enemy who won’t play by the rules. Then the Turks raid and destroy one of the holiest temples in the land: the magnificent Lord Shiva temple at Somnath.<br /><br />At this most desperate time, a warrior rises to defend the nation.<br /><br />Suheldev.<br /><br />The prince of a small kingdom, who sees what must be done for his motherland, and is willing to sacrifice his all for it.<br /><br />A fierce rebel.

A hunted, haunted Brahmin youth vows revenge for the gruesome murder of his beloved father. Cold, calculating, cruel and armed with a complete absence of accepted morals, he becomes the most powerful political strategist in Bharat and succeeds in uniting a ragged country against the invasion of the army of that demigod, Alexander the Great. Pitting the weak edges of both forces against each other, he pulls off a wicked and astonishing victory and succeeds in installing Chandragupta on the throne of the mighty Mauryan empire.<br /><br />History knows him as the brilliant strategist Chanakya. Satisfied—and a little bored—by his success as a kingmaker, through the simple summoning of his gifted mind, he recedes into the shadows to write his Arthashastra, the ‘science of wealth’. But history, which exults in repeating itself, revives Chanakya two and a half millennia later, in the avatar of Gangasagar Mishra, a Brahmin teacher in smalltown India who becomes puppeteer to a host of ambitious individuals—including a certain slumchild who grows up into a beautiful and powerful woman.<br /><br />Modern India happens to be just as riven as ancient Bharat by class hatred, corruption and divisive politics and this landscape is Gangasagar’s feasting ground. Can this wily pandit—who preys on greed, venality and sexual deviance—bring about another miracle of a united India? Will Chanakya’s chant work again?

Humanity despaired of its fate if the Blue God were to die but was reassured that he would return in a fresh avatar when needed in the eventual Dark Age—the Kaliyug.<br /><br />In modern times, a poor little rich boy grows up believing that he is that final avatar.<br /><br />Only, he is a serial killer.<br /><br />In this heart-stopping tale, the arrival of a murderer who executes his gruesome and brilliantly thought-out schemes in the name of God is the first clue to a sinister conspiracy to expose an ancient secret—Krishna’s priceless legacy to mankind.<br /><br />Historian Ravi Mohan Saini must breathlessly dash from the submerged remains of Dwarka and the mysterious lingam of Somnath to the icy heights of Mount Kailash, in a quest to discover the cryptic location of Krishna’s most prized possession. From the sand-washed ruins of Kalibangan to a Vrindavan temple destroyed by Aurangzeb, Saini must also delve into antiquity to prevent a gross miscarriage of justice.<br /><br />Ashwin Sanghi brings you yet another exhaustively researched whopper of a plot, while providing an incredible alternative interpretation of the Vedic Age that will be relished by conspiracy buffs and thriller-addicts alike., link=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15733523-the-krishna-key), Book(isbn=615384501, title=The Rozabal Line, publicationYear=2010, bestBookId=9471031, author=Author(authorGRId=4230687, name=Ashwin Sanghi, link=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4230687.Ashwin_Sanghi), image_url=https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png, avg_rating=3.32, description=A cardboard box is found on a shelf of a London library where a copy of Mahabharata should have been. When the mystified librarian opens it, she screams before she falls unconscious to the floor. An elite group calling itself the Lashkar-e-Talatashar has scattered around the globe, the fate of its members curiously resembling that of Christ and his Apostles. Their agenda is Armageddon. In the labyrinthine recesses of the Vatican, a beautiful assassin swears she will eliminate all who do not believe in her twisted credo. In Tibet, Buddhist monks search for a reincarnation while in strife-torn Kashmir, a tomb called Rozabal holds the key to an ancient riddle. Father Vincent Sinclair, has disturbing visions of himself and of people familiar to him, except that they seem located in other ages.

Except that they leave no trace of their methods. Welcome back to the shadowy and addictive world of Ashwin Sanghi. After <i>The Rozabal Line, Chanakya’s Chant, The Krishna Key and The Sialkot Saga, </i>Ashwin Sanghi returns at last with another quietly fearsome tale—this time of men who guard the ‘Kalachakra’ or The Wheel of Time. </p><p>Sanghi describes a world of people at war with one another—a boomeranging conflict of faiths that results in acts of such slow and planned human cruelty that they defy human imagination. Caught in the midst of this madness is Vijay Sundaram, a geek scientist who is only dimly aware that the wider sky outside his laboratory is stretched taut and close to being torn apart by forces that he wants simply to have nothing to do with. </p><p>But events conspire to propel Vijay into the labyrinth of Milesian Labs, a centre of research deep in the forested hills of Uttarakhand. What he stumbles upon is a primordial clue to a galactic secret that could accelerate the downward spiral of humankind. Trapped and wholly unaware of his actual foe, Vijay races against time to save humanity—and himself. </p><p>Zigzagging from Rama’s crossing to Lanka to the birth of Buddhism; from the origin of Wahhabism to the Einsteinian gravitational wave-detectors of LIGO; from the charnel-grounds of naked tantric practitioners to the bespoke suits of the Oval Office; and from the rites of Minerva, shrouded in frankincense, to the smoke-darkened ruins of Nalanda, <i>Keepers of the Kalachakra</i> is a journey that will have you gasping for breath—but one that you cannot abandon till all the pieces of the jigsaw come together. </p><p>Till you come up gobsmack against an end that you simply did not see coming. </p>, link=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36982571-keepers-of-the-kalachakra), Book(isbn=0, title=The Sialkot Saga, publicationYear=2016, bestBookId=28986040, author=Author(authorGRId=4230687, name=Ashwin Sanghi, link=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4230687.Ashwin_Sanghi), image_url=https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1455011113l/28986040._SX98_.jpg, avg_rating=3.71, description='When it’s a question of money, everybody is of the same religion.'<br /><br />The trajectories of Arvind and Arbaaz, both ‘businessmen’ of a kind whose lives are unwillingly intertwined, ricochet off one another while they play out their sinister and murderous plots of personal and professional one-upmanship, all the while breaking every rule in the book.<br /><br />Both are unaware that what they seek and fight over is the very obstacle in realising an ancient secret that dates back to a time long forgotten.<br /><br />And yet, at the heart of it all, there lies tenderness... and pathos... and blood... and rare moments of an almost exalted happiness.

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die.

He has summoned the townspeople to address their fears with truth:<br /><br />"Tomorrow, harmony will become discord. Joy will be replaced by grief. Peace will give way to war.... None of us can know what tomorrow will hold, because each day has its good and its bad moments. So, when you ask your questions, forget about the troops outside and the fear inside.

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.</p><p>Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.</p><p>The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.</p><p><i>In Veronika Decides to Die,</i> Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, <i>Veronika Decides to Die</i> questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal.

With a substantive new introduction on Freire's life and the remarkable impact of this book by writer and Freire confidant and authority Donaldo Macedo, this anniversary edition of <i>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i> will inspire a new generation of educators, students, and general readers for years to come., link=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72657.Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed), Book(isbn=60527986, title=Warrior of the Light, publicationYear=2004, bestBookId=1426, author=Author(authorGRId=566, name=Paulo Coelho, link=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/566.Paulo_Coelho), image_url=https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1359135200l/1426._SX98_.jpg, avg_rating=3.7, description=Warrior of the Light: A Manual is an inspirational companion to The Alchemist, an international bestseller that has beguiled millions of readers around the world.

Within months she was the most celebrated woman in the city. <br /> <br />As a dancer, she shocked and delighted audiences; as a courtesan, she bewitched the era’s richest and most powerful men. <br /> <br />But as paranoia consumed a country at war, Mata Hari’s lifestyle brought her under suspicion.

During the chaos of the ninth century B.C., Jezebel, wife to Israel's ruler, orders the execution of all prophets who refuse to worship the pagan god Baal. The young prophet Elijah, commanded by an angel of God to flee Israel, seeks safety in the land of Zarephath, where he unexpectedly finds true love with a young widow. But this new-found rapture is to be cut short, and Elijah sees all of his hopes and dreams irrevocably erased. What follows is sure to be viewed as Coelho's literary milestone: the quietly moving account of a man touched by the hand of God who must triumph over his frustrations in a soul-shattering trial of faith. Inspired by a circumstance that forever altered Coelho's own life, <i>The Fifth Mountain</i> is a testament to the truth that tragedy in life should not be considered a punishment but a challenge of the spirit. Gorgeous in its narrative and unforgettable in its prose, <i>The Fifth Mountain</i> teaches without being sanctimonious.

Jerusalem awaits the invasion of the crusaders who have surrounded the city's gates. There, inside the ancient city's walls, men and women of every age and every faith have gathered to hear the wise words of a mysterious man known only as the Copt. He has summoned the townspeople to address their fears with truth:<br /><br />"Tomorrow, harmony will become discord. Joy will be replaced by grief. Peace will give way to war.... None of us can know what tomorrow will hold, because each day has its good and its bad moments. So, when you ask your questions, forget about the troops outside and the fear inside. Our task is not to leave a record of what happened on this date for those who will inherit the Earth; history will take care of that. Therefore, we will speak about our daily lives, about the difficulties we have had to face."<br /><br />The people begin with questions about defeat, struggle, and the nature of their enemies; they contemplate the will to change and the virtues of loyalty and solitude; and they ultimately turn to questions of beauty, love, wisdom, sex, elegance, and what the future holds. "What is success?" poses the Copt. "It is being able to go to bed each night with your soul at peace."<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />Now, these many centuries later, the wise man's answers are a record of the human values that have endured throughout time.

They were a generation refusing to live the robotic and unquestioning life that their parents had known.<br /><br />At this time, Paulo is a young, skinny Brazilian with a goatee and long, flowing hair who wants to become a writer. He sets off on a journey in search of freedom and a deeper meaning for his life: first, with a girlfriend, on the famous “Death Train to Bolivia,” then on to Peru and later hitchhiking through Chile and Argentina.<br /><br />His travels take him further, to the famous square in Amsterdam, where Paulo meets Karla, a Dutch woman also in her 20s. She convinces Paulo to join her on a trip to Nepal, aboard the Magic Bus that travels across Europe and Central Asia to Kathmandu. They embark on a journey in the company of fascinating fellow travelers, each of whom has a story to tell, and each of whom will undergo a transformation, changing their priorities and values, along the way. As they travel together, Paulo and Karla explore their own relationship, an awakening on every level that brings each of them to a choice and a decision that sets the course for their lives thereafter., link=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39731666-hippie), Book(isbn=61122416, title=The Alchemist, publicationYear=1993, bestBookId=865, author=Author(authorGRId=566, name=Paulo Coelho, link=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/566.Paulo_Coelho), image_url=https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1483412266l/865._SX98_.jpg, avg_rating=3.87, description=Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure.

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.</p><p>Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.</p><p>The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.</p><p><i>In Veronika Decides to Die,</i> Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, <i>Veronika Decides to Die</i> questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.</p>, link=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1431.Veronika_Decides_to_Die), Book(isbn=61122092, title=By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept, publicationYear=2006, bestBookId=1428, author=Author(authorGRId=566, name=Paulo Coelho, link=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/566.Paulo_Coelho), image_url=https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1466877798l/1428._SX98_.jpg, avg_rating=3.57, description=From Paulo Coelho, author of the bestselling <i>The Alchemist</i>, comes a poignant, richly poetic story that reflects the depth of love and life.<br /><br />Rarely does adolescent love reach its full potential, but what happens when two young lovers reunite after eleven years?
